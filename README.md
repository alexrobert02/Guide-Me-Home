# Guide-Me-Home

## Description
Guide Me Home is a mobile application for those who suffer from topographic disorientation, in most cases people suffering from Alzheimer's. This application tracks users' positions, offers pre-established routes, with which they can navigate to the most frequently visited locations, providing safe and reliable navigation for both familiar and unfamiliar routes.
